## CS 4690 - Pokemon Project

This is a project which originated from a love of pokemon, and the lack of similar resources available online. This project allows the user to look up any pokemon from any of the available pokemon games, and then construct a team of 6 members. Once members are picked, the user can look at the details for each pokemon which include types, weaknesses, stats, and all of the possible moves. Users can also select the moves they'd like each pokemon to have (up to 4). 

## But why?

First and foremost, this project came about because pokemon are AWESOME, and we love them. Secondly, this project fulfilled the requirements for a final project within our CS 4690 Class. It gave us an opportunity to practice some the of the skills and implement some of the knowledge we gained in this class in a way that was fun for us personally. 

Hopefully, if you happened upon this project while cruising across github, you'll get as much enjoyment out of this project as we did.  

## Installation

Step 1: Have node (version 6.*), npm, and mongoDB installed. Make sure mongo is running on port 27017. 

Step 2: Clone the repository to your local drive.

Step 3: Browse to location on local drive where repository was cloned in your terminal. In the folder containing the package.json, type "npm install". This should install all of the neccessary modules to get the app up and running

Step 5: Type "npm start" to boot up the app. 

All done! The server will display to the console that it is listening. Head to your browser and type "localhost:3000" in the URL. After you look up some pokemon and add them to your team, it should look like this:
